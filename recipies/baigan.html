    <h1>Baigan ka Bharta</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Baingan bharta is a popular Punjabi dish from the North Indian cuisine. It is made with a mash of roasted eggplant, onions, tomatoes, herbs and spices. The eggplants are roasted or grilled on direct flame or on red hot charcoal which gives them a smoky flavor and taste. I share a simply delicious family heirloom recipe that is not overloaded with spices so that the smoky flavors of the roasted eggplant and tanginess of the tomatoes come through in the dish.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Baigan/Eggplant</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Tomatos</li>
        <li>Basic Indian Masala</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the baingan (eggplant or aubergine) in water. Pat dry with a kitchen napkin. Cut the eggplant from its base up-to an inch away from the stem without breaking it apart.</li>
        <li>Gently pull apart.</li>
        <li>Open the cut parts slightly more and check for worms or any black spots. Discard the eggplant if you see any worms in it. </li>
        <li>If the eggplant looks clean and without worms, you can proceed further. Optionally rub a bit of oil all over it. </li>
        <li>With the help of tongs, keep turning the eggplant after 2 to 3 minutes on the flame, so that it is evenly cooked. </li>
        <li>Roast the aubergine till it’s completely cooked and tender. With a knife or fork check the doneness. The knife should slide easily in eggplant without any resistance. </li>
        <li> Remove the eggplant and immerse in a bowl of water till it cools.</li>
        <li>In a kadai or pan or skillet heat 2 tablespoons oil. You can use peanut oil or sunflower oil or mustard oil. Sometimes I make the bharta in mustard oil which gives the dish its unique pungent taste.

            Then add finely chopped 1 medium-sized onion (about ½ cup finely chopped onion). Also, add finely chopped 5 to 6 medium garlic cloves (about 1 heaped teaspoon of finely chopped garlic).</li>
            <li>Sauté the onions till they soften and turn translucent, stirring often. Don’t brown them.</li>
            <li>Add 1 chopped green chili (about ½ teaspoon of chopped green chillies) and mix. At this point you can add a pinch of asafoetida (hing), if you prefer. But if you follow a gluten-free diet, omit adding the asafoetida.</li>
            <li>Add finely chopped 2 medium to large tomatoes (about 1 cup finely chopped tomatoes). Mix very well.</li>
            <li>Sauté the tomatoes until the oil starts separating from the mixture. You have to keep on stirring often when sautéing tomatoes. </li>
            <li>Now add ¼ teaspoon red chili powder or cayenne. Stir and mix well.</li>
            <li> Add the chopped or mashed eggplant.</li>
            <li> Combine, stir and mix the mashed eggplant very well with the onion-tomato masala mixture. Season with salt as per taste.</li>
            <li>Sauté baingan bharta stirring often for about 4 to 5 minutes on low to medium-low heat.</li>
            <li>The baingan bharta is ready. Finally stir in 1 tablespoon coriander leaves or garnish with chopped coriander leaves. </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Serving suggestions</h2>
    <p>Serve baingan ka bharta with phulka or chapati or paratha. It goes well even with bread, toasted or grilled bread and plain steamed rice or jeera rice.

        You can also serve it as a side veggie dish with any North Indian meal.</p>
